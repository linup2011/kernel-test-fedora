In standard sockets, the payload to be transmitted is encapsulated according to the chosen transport layer protocol (e.g. TCP, UDP).
In contrast, raw sockets usually receive raw packets including the header. When transmitting packets, the automatic addition of a header
may be a configurable option of the socket.

The system calls sendmsg() that are used to transmit a message to another socket. Next rawv6_sendmgs() and rawv6_send_hdrinc() are called
to transmit the message from sending raw socket. If IPPROTO_RAW or IP_HDRINCL option is specified in socket() or setsockopt(), user needs 
to construct his/her own IP and uppder layer header structures.

rawv6_getsockopt should be called if socket is rawv6 prot type. Operation not supported is returned if socket protocl is not equal to
IPPROTO_ICMPV6, otherwise rawv6_geticmpfilter() should be called.
